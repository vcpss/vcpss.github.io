<h1> Quick hummus recipe </h1>

<p><strong><u>This</u> recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong> It has been adapted from a number of
    different recipes that
    I have read over the years. </p>

<p> Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads. </p>

<h2> Ingredients </h2>

<p>
    <em>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</em><br>
    <em>175g of tahini </em><br>
    <em>6 sundried tomatoe </em><br>
    <em>Half a red pepper</em><br>
    <em>A pinch of cayenne </em>pepper<br>
    <em>1 clove of garlic</em><br>
    <em>A dash of olive oil</em><br>
</p>

<h2> Instructions </h2>

<p>
    Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely <br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely <br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor <br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste. <br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time <br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time <br>
</p>

<p>
    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
</p>

<h2> Storage </h2>

<p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
</p>

<p>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
